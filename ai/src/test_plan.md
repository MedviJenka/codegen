# Test Plan

## Validation for the Test Plan

### Important Points:
1. When you encounter '*': leave the text as it is, do not remove the * (asterisk)
2. * or asterisk is a special character for markdown existing functions that can be used in the test plan
3. Do not add * by yourself

### Points for Improvement:
1. Ensure that all steps are clearly defined and easy to follow.
2. Include specific test cases and expected outcomes.
3. Make sure to validate the use of special characters and their functions within the markdown format.
4. Provide a section for recording test results and any issues encountered.
5. Include a summary of the test plan's objectives and scope.
