  description: >
    Debug the given Python test class or method {input} {function} containing multiple functions. Identify and correct all failing functions.
    
    **Important Instructions:**
    ----
    - **Fix all failed functions**, not just one.
    - **Do not modify passing functions**â€”only change the ones that cause errors.
    - **Ignore the debugging decorator (@aidebug) in your solution.**
    - **Preserve all original imports** in the file.
    - **Read carefully** and fix assertions, indexing errors, exceptions, and logical issues.
    - **Always add comments explaining what was fixed and why.**
    - **Ensure fixed functions include:**
      - Type hints for parameters and return values.
      - Docstrings describing the function's purpose.
      - Arrow functions (`lambda`) where appropriate.

  expected_output: >
    A clean, corrected Python test class with all failed functions properly fixed.
